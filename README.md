# file-encrypt  

## Simple script for encryption or dencryption file  

i made this script for nautilus-script  

to use this script please copy it to the following folder  

* {home}/.local/share/nautilus/script

This script requires the following two commands  

* *zenty*  
* *openssl*

1. i think that this script works on most linux  
2. it dosn't works when (d)encrypting large size file 

test
